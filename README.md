# Alita AI - Basic AI Assistant

## Overview

Alita AI is a simple typing-based AI assistant created by Ajay (AJ). It utilizes the Google Generative AI (Gemini) API to deliver answers and has been developed using Python. The assistant includes the `gtts` pip package for text-to-speech functionality, making interactions both insightful and conversational.

## Features

- **Text Input:**
  - Users can interact with Alita by typing their queries or commands.

- **Google Generative AI API:**
  - Utilizes the Google Gemini API to fetch and deliver answers to user queries.

- **Text-to-Speech:**
  - Implements the `gtts` pip package for converting text responses to speech.

## Usage

1. **Type Your Query:**
   - Interact with Alita by typing your questions or commands.

2. **Receive Responses:**
   - Alita processes the input using the Google Gemini API and provides responses.

3. **Text-to-Speech:**
   - Optionally, utilize the text-to-speech feature to hear responses.

## How to Run

1. Install Python on your machine.
2. Set up your Google API Key:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following line:
     ```env
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
3. Run the Alita AI Python script:
   - For Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook Alita_AI.ipynb
     ```
     
## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced User Interface:**
  - Consider adding a graphical user interface for a more user-friendly experience.

- **Expanded Functionality:**
  - Integrate additional APIs for broader functionality and information retrieval.

- **Context Awareness:**
  - Enable multi-query sessions with context-aware responses.
